## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

   **Title**: What is the title of your project?
   
   
   Hangman Game
    
    
   **Purpose**: In a single sentence, describe what your project will do.
    
    
   The game of hangman: will invite the user to guess words from possible word bank and by guessing letter by letter the 
    turtle will be drawing the hangman. 
    
    
️**Sources**: Which assignments or code will you base your project on?


   T13 and T15
    
    
️**Kanban Board**: What is the link to the Kanban board on Trello?

## Milestone 2: Code

Have updated the Kanban board on Trello. Also updated CRC cards and now have a basic structure in which my coding will go :).

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-in


Completion Percentage: 55% 


I am very confident that I would have my project completed by friday. I have more than 50 percent of the game completed 
all that needs to be done will be implementing the user interaction and the turtle and I should figure that out in two days. 
My biggest problem is interacting the two classes. If I can't figure out by tomorrow morning, I will attend the wednesday 
TA lab to get help.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ❗User Instructions

In the game of hangman, you have six tries to guess the word that is selected. You can either guess the word entirely or by letters.
If you guess a letter correctly I will appear on the dashed line which indicate where that letter belong in the word. If the letter is not
in the word, part of the hangman will draw for example your first incorrect guessed letter will draw the head of the hangman and your second 
incorrect guessed will draw the body and so on. If you run out of tries the it will let you know you lost and exit out of the window.

### ❗Errors and Constraints

I only have TypeError which took me a while and I still couldn't figure it out.
### ❗Reflection


I have selected this game because I though it was different and others were doing similar games so I decided to do something different.
This game is very easy to understand in the rules of play and it was major key in my decision. I also felt it was within my capabilities 
to execute its functionality with the requirements assign. I felt I have achieved what was being aimed for for this project. 


My initial design set me up step ahead. My initial design is the same way i executed my game. I plan was to have the turtle draw the body part of the hangman
on a class with each body part being different method. I called for the body part as the number of tries decrease by one after every incorrectly 
guessed. My pre design code looks very similar to my final one with a code. I learn how to Implement user interaction via event handling.
also how to have all the interaction through the program and screen and not on solely on python console.


The hardest part that took the longest for me to figure out was having the dash lines filled out after correctly being guessed.
I had to create another empty list and append it, but that took longer than it should've. If I had another week or so, my game would've definitely
been better in terms not only perfecting my code but adding more features. I would also make more use of the classes rather than trying to not use them well.
I felt I didn't get the best of classes.
