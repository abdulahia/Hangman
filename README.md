### ❗User Instructions

In the game of hangman, you have six tries to guess the word that is selected. You can either guess the word entirely or by letters.
If you guess a letter correctly I will appear on the dashed line which indicate where that letter belong in the word. If the letter is not
in the word, part of the hangman will draw for example your first incorrect guessed letter will draw the head of the hangman and your second 
incorrect guessed will draw the body and so on. If you run out of tries the it will let you know you lost and exit out of the window.

### ❗Reflection


I have selected this game because I though it was different and others were doing similar games so I decided to do something different.
This game is very easy to understand in the rules of play and it was major key in my decision. I also felt it was within my capabilities 
to execute its functionality with the requirements assign. I felt I have achieved what was being aimed for for this project. 


My initial design set me up step ahead. My initial design is the same way i executed my game. I plan was to have the turtle draw the body part of the hangman
on a class with each body part being different method. I called for the body part as the number of tries decrease by one after every incorrectly 
guessed. My pre design code looks very similar to my final one with a code. I learn how to Implement user interaction via event handling.
also how to have all the interaction through the program and screen and not on solely on python console.


The hardest part that took the longest for me to figure out was having the dash lines filled out after correctly being guessed.
I had to create another empty list and append it, but that took longer than it should've. If I had another week or so, my game would've definitely
been better in terms not only perfecting my code but adding more features. I would also make more use of the classes rather than trying to not use them well.
I felt I didn't get the best of classes.
